Task will contain all desirable attributes, such as the description, ID, priority, duration, and dependencies. I have decided to create instances of each subtask rather than each overall task as it becomes easier to schedule. Otherwise, we may either require many nested lists (as subtasks will have different attributes themselves such as durations, descriptions, ids), and potentially methods that separate this list to extract each subtask as an instance for the task scheduler to use. By doing this, I have assumed that it is ok to begin subtasks from different activities and to overlap their completion."

    "My scheduler will work by first creating a heap, a data structure to store those tasks that have no dependencies in this case. Using the priorities of tasks with no dependencies, the scheduler will create a min heap, with the task which has a lowest priority value (highest priority) at the root node/the first position in the queue. The scheduler will take the highest priority (lowest value) from the front of the queue to complete next. Each time a task is completed, the queue will be updated to add those whose dependencies have been completed. This process will repeat until a base case is reached: there are no tasks left in the queue, and no tasks that have not yet been started.<sub>5</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "The priority queue is a well-suited data structure for this application as it allows for tasks to be initiated and pushed into the queue. In this procedure, all information about each can be held in instances of tasks, allowing us to access any information about any position in the queue very easily. Furthermore, we can very easily manipulate the queue (add tasks, change priorities, etc.) and not worry about keeping the highest priority task at the top of our list, as all these methods ensure that a valid min heap remains. The complexity required to rearrange the heap in the case of both adding and changing a key is low as we only have to worry about changing the position of the key we are changing/adding, we do not have to create the heap from scratch, therefore few swaps are made in heap restructuring. \n",
    "\n",
    "We may alternatively use another sorting method to order the list of tasks and retrieve the highest priority task, however this method is likely computationally costly, as many comparisons and swaps/recursions would be needed in most sorting cases. Even using one of best sorting algorithms, mergesort, we have a runtime growth of O(NlogN), more than is required to restructure a heap in this implementation (O(logN)). This also does not allow us to perform methods such as changing key values or adding tasks without undergoing the entire sorting algorithm again.<sub>1, 2</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "I have defined priority as a value from 0 to 100, 100 being the lowest priority, and 0 the highest priority. I created these as attributes for each instance of a task by relating priorities to each other. I first decided which of my tasks needed to be highest priority (pre-class work for CS110), and which needed to be lowest (going to the Palace), then chose priorities for the other tasks based on these markers, which tasks I could complete another day, and those that are unimportant. By defining priority values as a task attribute that must be specified, I am ensuring that my program does not run into any unexpected errors that could be caused through computing priority values in the program, and allowing more factors to be taken into consideration in this calculation. Furthermore, the task scheduler only queues tasks without dependencies, therefore this is implicitly taken into consideration without needing to be involved in the priority value calculation."

For example, walking to the cafe can be completed in conjunction with recalling common Korean phrases. Therefore, these 2 task IDs can be found in each others multitasking lists. This way, I can keep track of which tasks can be completed together and which cannot, so no 2 tasks will be completed at the same time that don't make sense together (such as CS110 pre-class work, and searching for a birthday gift for a friend). If a task is multitasked, the task will be popped, and the heapify method will be implemented on the new priority queue to ensure it still has the task with the highest priority (lowest value) at the start of the queue. This works in exactly the same manner as removing the first task.<sub>4, 5</sub>"

    "Firstly, following the schedule was much more time efficient for me personally, as I did not have to make any decisions, which often take me an unnatural amount of time. The scheduler also ensured that no tasks with uncompleted dependencies are completed, something that could be difficult/time consuming to calculate manually. Furthermore, the schedule allowed me to complete multiple tasks in conjunction with each other, such as recalling Hangul characters while packing my bag for the cafe. This is not something that I would generally consider doing as I am not usually that organised. This saved me some time by forcing me to multitask where I am able. The task scheduler has also shown me how much free time I actually should have in a day, and how much I could potentially complete; there is definitely enough time in this day to practice my Korean, something I often fail to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there was a major pitfall with my schedule, as it required me to pack a bag to go to the palace while I was already outside the reshall at the shops, which was not possible. This could be a repetitive issue for any tasks that require you to be in a specific place to complete. The schedule also assumes that there are no unforeseen tasks that need to be completed. For example, during this day, my parents called me, therefore interupting the schedule. Lastly, this scheduler would not work in the case that a certain task needs to be completed at a specific time (eg. CS110 class), as it only queues tasks based on priority values inputed and no start times are involved."

    "* Time: As you can see from the outputs above, the scheduler produces a schedule that should take about 7.5-8.5 hours to complete. In reality, it is likely that this will be an underestimate due to unforeseen circumstances such as buses running late, impromptu meetings, or the need for food. Despite this, the time taken to complete these tasks is much less than if I didn't have a plan, as these tasks have taken me longer than a full day before! Therefore, the use of the schedule forces me to be more efficient in completing tasks.\n",
    "* Multitasking: The use of multitasking reduces the time of the above schedule by about 30 minutes, a small but potentially significant amount of time if I used a multitasking scheduler every day. The use of multitasking is something I am unlikely to do on a normal day due to a lack of thought and planning, therefore this aspect of the scheduler makes using it much more time efficient than not. The scheduler could, however, be even more time-efficient by allowing for multiple tasks to be completed while another one is in action (2 tasks in duration of 1 other).\n",
    "* Individual task efficiencies: Because each task has a set time in the schedule, in the trial run, I payed much more attention to how long I was spending. For example, at the Palace, I conciously made an effort to stay only an hour and not more, making it more time efficient than without a schedule. However, the scheduler fails to take into consideration the time of day at which tasks are completed. For example, I will take more time to complete mentally-taxing tasks, such as CS110 pre-class work later on in the day, so they should be completed earlier to reduce their time taken. In this way, my intuition for which tasks to complete could be better than the scheduler.<sub>3</sub>"

All these factors would allow for a more accurate and time-efficient schedule. However, even with these adaptations, there are still unexpected activities throughout my day, therefore I would prefer to use this adapted scheduler as a guide and not follow it too closely.<sub>6</sub>"

    "* Algorithms<sub>1</sub>- I have created code that uses the basis of a sorting method of a heap to implement a task scheduler. I have commented, and documented this code. Furthermore, I have explained how this data structure works and why this is an advantageous implementation in this specific case, comparing it to other potential strategies that I could have chosen instead. \n",
    "* AlgorithmicStrategies<sub>2</sub>- I have used a heap data structure to create my task scheduler. I have explained and justified the multiple advantages of this data structure, as well as contrasting it with other sorting algorithms (specifically mergesort) to implement a task scheduler. I have provided some specific evidence, using a complexity analysis, as to why the heap data structure is better suited to the problem than mergesort.\n",
    "* CodeReadability- I have commented all my code, in particular sections that may be difficult to understand if I come back to the code or for others to comprehend. I have balanced creating sections of code that both aren't too overwhelmingly commented that they become difficult to read, and have enough comments to be understandable. I have also included docstrings in methods within classes that require an explanation further than that in the method name, and included error messages in my minheap implementation for the ease of the user debugging (otherwise the program will run into confusions when restructuring the minheap and will break).\n",
    "* ComputationalCritique<sub>3</sub>- I have come to conclusions about the efficiency of the schedule I have created, comparing this to the lack of a schedule (and just deciding at the time). I have therefore given the merits and pitfalls of this scheduler using several different measures (time, multitasking capabilities, efficiency of individual tasks). Given these factors, I have come to a conclusion as to whether or not I would use the task scheduler, and in what instances the same implementation (but with some adaptations) may be more useful.\n",
    "* Constraints<sub>4</sub>- Using the multitasking constraints imposed on the task scheduler problem, I have adapted my code. I have explained how I have overcome this constraint by using a multitasking list attribute where the user determines which tasks can be completed in conjunction with each other and which cannot. I have explained why this is a better way to deal with the constraint than to try and compute multitasking capabilities another way as the user is able to take into consideration many more factors.\n",
    "* DataStructures<sub>5</sub>- I have implemented the minheap data structure within a class, creating many different methods to complement the data structure. I have explained in detail how the heap works as a data structure to create the task scheduler, and the methods it uses, specifying why the heap allows us to remove the first element to perform the highest priority task and very easily restructure into a valid minheap. I have also commented on how multitasking affects (or doesn't in this case) our use of the heap data structure.\n",
    "* Induction<sub>6</sub>- I have used inductive reasoning to draw conclusions about whether or not I would use my task scheduler on a daily basis. Using the multiple lines of reasoning laid out in question 5, I have provided evidence for why I may choose to not use this program in the future (causal inference). I would say that my inductive conclusion is fairly reliable, as the statements I have made are based on my analysis of how the code exactly functions, which will not change between runs (unless I conciously change it). \n",
    "* PythonProgramming- I have created code that creates a priority queue as set out in the task, using my own min heap implementation. I have then modified this code to account for multitasking. My code creates an accurate schedule. Though this has a couple of flaws, I have specified how we may go about fixing these to create a more advanced task scheduler."
